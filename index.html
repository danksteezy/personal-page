							<p>I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Yeah, well, have you seen the new Mustang? You could hump that hood. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. Tobias Fünke costume. Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something?</p>

							<p>Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen.</p>

							<p>The only person that gets Lucille this excited is Gene. This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful!</p>

							<p>Look, you are playing adults…with fully formed libidos, not 2 young men playing grab-ass in the shower. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi.
							</p>
							<p>Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. ♪♪ Somewhere… over the rainbow… there's another rainbow… ♪♪</p>

							<p>I want to cry so bad, but I don't think I can spare the moisture. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Family Love Michael. A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine.</p>

							<p>Oh…yeah…the guy in the…the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? Teamocil. I hate the Wetlands. They're stupid and wet, and there are bugs everywhere, and I think I maced a crane. Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. And I am rock steady. No more dizzies.</p>

							<p>I know what an erection feels like, Michael. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. You were just a turd out there, you know? You couldn't kick, and you couldn't run, you know? You were just a turd. Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Let me out that Queen.</p>

							<p>Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter.</p>

							I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? Oh…yeah…the guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. Look what the homosexuals have done to me! You can't just comb that out and reset it? She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn?
